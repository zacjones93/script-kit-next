# Script Kit GPUI - Expert Review Request

## Project Context

Script Kit GPUI is a **Rust desktop app** built with GPUI (Zed's UI framework) that serves as a command launcher and script runner. Think: Raycast/Alfred but scriptable with TypeScript.

**Architecture:**
- **GPUI** for UI rendering (custom immediate-mode reactive UI framework from Zed)
- **Bun** as the TypeScript runtime for user scripts
- **Stdin/stdout JSON protocol** for bidirectional script ↔ app communication
- **SQLite** for persistence (clipboard history, notes, chat)
- **macOS-first** with floating panel window behavior

**Key Constraints:**
- Must maintain backwards compatibility with existing Script Kit scripts
- Performance-critical: launcher must appear instantly, list scrolling at 60fps
- Multi-window: main launcher + Notes window + AI chat window (all independent)
- Theme hot-reload across all windows
