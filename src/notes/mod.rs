//! Notes Module - Raycast Notes Feature Parity
//!
//! A separate floating notes window built with gpui-component library.
//!
//! ## Features
//! - Floating notes window with global hotkey access
//! - Markdown/rich text editing with live preview
//! - Multiple notes management with sidebar list
//! - Quick capture from anywhere
//! - Auto-sizing window that grows with content
//! - Persistent storage (local SQLite)
//! - Formatting toolbar with keyboard shortcuts
//! - Search across all notes
//! - Export (plain text, markdown, HTML)
//! - Menu bar integration
//! - Recently deleted notes (soft delete with recovery)
//!
//! ## Architecture
//! The Notes feature runs in a completely separate window from the main Script Kit
//! launcher. It uses gpui-component for UI components (Input, Sidebar, Button, etc.)
//! and follows the Root wrapper pattern required by gpui-component.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ```ignore
//! use crate::notes::{NotesApp, open_notes_window};
//!
//! // Open notes window (creates new or focuses existing)
//! open_notes_window(cx);
//!
//! // Quick capture - opens notes with new note focused
//! quick_capture(cx);
//! ```
