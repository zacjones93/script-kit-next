The issue is that cx.activate(true) and makeKeyAndOrderFront cause macOS to switch spaces BEFORE setCollectionBehavior is called.\n\nRoot cause: configure_as_floating_panel() is called AFTER cx.activate(true) and move_first_window_to_bounds() (which calls makeKeyAndOrderFront). By the time MoveToActiveSpace is set, the space switch has already happened.\n\nFix: Set the collection behavior BEFORE any activation/ordering.
