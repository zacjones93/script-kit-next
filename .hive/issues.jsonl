The issue is that cx.activate(true) and makeKeyAndOrderFront cause macOS to switch spaces BEFORE setCollectionBehavior is called.\n\nRoot cause: configure_as_floating_panel() is called AFTER cx.activate(true) and move_first_window_to_bounds() (which calls makeKeyAndOrderFront). By the time MoveToActiveSpace is set, the space switch has already happened.\n\nFix: Set the collection behavior BEFORE any activation/ordering.

{"id":"cell--9bnr5-mjp9intzvok","title":"Fix: TypeScript scriptlets block UI - need async execution","description":"## Problem\nWhen executing a TypeScript scriptlet (tool: ts/kit/bun), the app beach balls because:\n1. `execute_scriptlet()` in main.rs calls `executor::run_scriptlet()` synchronously\n2. `run_scriptlet()` calls `execute_typescript()` which uses `Command::output()` - a blocking call\n3. TypeScript scriptlets with SDK preload wait for STDIN input via the JSON protocol\n4. But we're blocking on `.output()` waiting for the process to finish\n5. Deadlock: script waits for input, app waits for script\n\n## Solution\nTypeScript scriptlets that use the SDK need to be run asynchronously using the existing spawned process pattern used for regular scripts:\n1. Spawn child process with piped stdin/stdout/stderr\n2. Use the existing JSONL protocol for communication\n3. Handle the same way as running a regular .ts script file\n\n## Workaround for Non-SDK TypeScript\nFor TypeScript scriptlets that DON'T use the SDK (simple scripts), the current synchronous approach may work. We could:\n1. Check if the scriptlet uses SDK features\n2. If no SDK needed, run synchronously \n3. If SDK needed, run via the existing script runner\n\n## Files Affected\n- src/main.rs: execute_scriptlet() should spawn like regular scripts\n- src/executor.rs: execute_typescript() may need async variant","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-28T05:01:56.135Z","updated_at":"2025-12-28T05:06:04.159Z","closed_at":"2025-12-28T05:06:04.159Z","parent_id":"cell--9bnr5-mjp6x5ws9g1","dependencies":[],"labels":[],"comments":[]}

Using a grouped-list index on a flat list returns the wrong item\n\n## Correct Pattern\n`get_focused_script_info()` at line 6938 shows the correct approach - using `get_grouped_results()` to properly map from `selected_index` to actual result.\n\n## Fix Required\nUpdate `edit_script` action handler to either:\n1. Use `get_focused_script_info()` like the dialog creation does, OR\n2. Use the `focused_script` already stored in ActionsDialog\n\nThe same bug likely affects `reveal_in_finder` at line 2561 which uses the same incorrect pattern.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-30T05:02:13.350Z","updated_at":"2025-12-30T05:07:21.527Z","closed_at":"2025-12-30T05:07:21.527Z","dependencies":[],"labels":[],"comments":[]}

The render code silently corrects this, but `last_scrolled_index` stabilization thinks we already scrolled there, creating a fight.\n\n## Fix Required\n1. Make `move_selection_by()` use `get_grouped_results_cached()` and skip section headers like other methods\n2. Consider removing unconditional `scroll_to_reveal_item` from `render_script_list.rs:139-140`\n\n## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT\n- DO NOT break mouse wheel scrolling - the `scroll_to_reveal_item` in render may be needed for mouse wheel.
